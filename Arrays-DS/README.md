# Arrays - DS
<p>An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, <em>A</em>, of size <em>N</em>, each memory location has some unique index, <em>i</em> (where 0 ≤ <em>i</em> < <em>N</em>), that can be referenced as <em>A</em>[<em>i</em>] (you may also see it written as <em>Ai</em></p>
<p>Given an array, <em>A</em>, of <em>N</em> integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers</p>

# Note:
If you've already solved our C++ domain's Array introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

# Input Format
<p>The first line contains an integer, <em>N</em> (the number of integers in <em>A</em>).</p>
<p>The second line contains <em>N</em> space-separated integers describing <em>A</em>.

# Constraints
<ul>
<li>1 ≤ <em>N</em> ≤ 10^3</li>
<li>1 ≤ <em>Ai</em> ≤ 10^4, where <em>Ai</em> is the <em>ith</em> integer in <em>A</em></li>

# Output Format
Print all <em>N</em> integers in <em>A</em> in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers

# Sample Input 1
<code>
<p>4</p>
<p>1 4 3 2</p>
</code>

# Sample Output 1
<code>
2 3 4 1
